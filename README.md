### About
An Entity Component System (ECS) written in C++<br/>
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system)

---
### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kz04px/ecs
cd ./ecs
make
```

### Status
Still a work in progress. Some potential features currently lacking, like an events system.

---
### Example
A rough asteroids clone serves as an example of how to use the ECS. SDL2 and SDL2_image are required.
